## *Some concept based data structure program from start to end*
1. *Array :-*
      * *Array manipulation*
      * *Array insert,delete,reverse,sort*
2. *Linked List :-*
      * *creation of linked list*
      * *creation of singly linked list*
      * *creation of doubly linked list*
      * *creation of circular linked list*
      * *creation of polynomial*
      * *insertion to singly linked list*
      * *insertion to doubly linked list* 
      * *insertion to circular linked list*
      * *insertion to polynomial equation*
      * *deletion from singly linked list*
      * *deletion from doubly linked list*
      * *insertion at begining in linked list*
      * *insertion at end of linked list*
      * *insertion at middel of linked list*
      * *insertion at random position of linked list*
      * *insertion of another linked list into existing linked list*
      * *deletion at begining of linked list*
      * *deletion from end of linked list*
      * *deletion from both begining and end from linked list*
      * *deletion from random position of linked list*
      * *deletion of more than one element from linked list*
